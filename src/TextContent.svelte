            While we haven't particularly missed his tweets, I thought it would be a fun idea to see if we could generate tweets that are insane but coherent with his style. 
            The tweet you see below is <b>not necessarily real</b>. If it is real, then the <b>date/retweets/favorites</b> are accurate!
